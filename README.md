A brief recipe website to showcase some basic html skills

This project will demonstrate some basic foundational html skills such as working with html files, boilerplate, using semantic html, working with lists, linking to different web pages, and including images. I will also use this project to practice working with git and github, committing my project at reasonable intervals, and creating useful and concise commit messages.
